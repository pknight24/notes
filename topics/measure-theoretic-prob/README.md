# Measure Theoretic Probability Notes

The goal of this repository is to build a useful collection of notes on measure
theory and probability that is self-contained and easily sharable. I will draw
the material from the following resources:

- *A User's Guide to Measure Theoretic Probability* by Pollard (Primary)
- *Probability and Measure by Billingsley* (Secondary)
