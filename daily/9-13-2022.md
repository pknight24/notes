- [x] Sparse RRR
  - [x] Rui meeting at 10:30a
  - [x] read about entry-wise concentration before meeting
- [x] Submatrix
  - [x] Notes on Andy's thesis
    - how does dimmensionality enter the picture?
      - see sections B.4.2 and B.4.3. It seems like if K/N is bounded away from
        0, the eigenvalues of \Sigma_{GR} are actually O(N/K). This then affects
        the asymptotic bounds on the mean and variance of the scan statistics in
        B.4.4, which in turn impacts the results that follow.
