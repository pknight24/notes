- [x] BST240 Problem 2 (Exercise 2.3)
- [x] Read Chapter 2 of Andy's thesis
	can we test for 'structure' in beta using the score statistics?
	
things to review:
- score tests with nuisance parameters and for composite alternatives
- kronecker products + vectorization tricks

a question: why does the score approach work? I have intuition for why score
tests work for less structured alternatives, but how do we know that the
structure in the score matrix reflects the structure in $\beta$? i.e., how does
testing for a specific structure in $\beta$ via the score matrix work?

also just to clarify: all we test for is whether the structure is present. we
don't care about 'where' the submatrix is - correct? This is counterintuitive to
me. Don't we care about which genes and phenotypes are associated? I guess that
ACAT-SCAN does provide this info... but its confusing to me where ACAT-SCAN fits
into the testing procedure.
