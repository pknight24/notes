- cross traits PRS are popular for assessing genetic correlation between complex
  traits via GWAS summary stats
- however: there is empirical evidence that even a highly significant cross
  trait PRS will only explain a very small amount of variance even when traits
  are highly similar and highly heritable
- this paper contributes a theoretical investigation of cross trait PRS
