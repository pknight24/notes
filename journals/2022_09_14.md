- [[Submatrix Detection]]
	- DONE Rajarshi Meeting at 4pm
		- for next week: try to calculate the expected value of the test statistic under the alternative as he did on the board
		- in the [[Methods for Multiple Phenotypeâ€”Multiple Genotype Testing and for COVID-19 Spread Modeling]] Section B.4.4, observe that $E_{H_1}(T) - E_{H_0}(T)$ will not diverge in the high dimensional setting. Rajarshi's idea is to take full advantage of the double-sparse structure of $\beta$ to characterize $E_{H_1}(T)$ in terms of the *restricted* eigenvalues of $\Sigma_{GR}$, rather than the normal eigenvalues.
