	- DONE Notes on Andy's thesis
		- how does dimensionality enter the picture?
			- see sections B.4.2 and B.4.3. It seems like if K/N is bounded away from
			  0, the eigenvalues of \Sigma_{GR} are actually O(N/K). This then affects
			  the asymptotic bounds on the mean and variance of the scan statistics in B.4.4, which in turn impacts the results that follow
