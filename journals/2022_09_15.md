	- thinking about Andy's maximal statistic
		- I think i have a lower bound and upper bound on the 'signal' in the test statistic, in terms of the restricted singular values of $I_R^TG^TG$, but I'm not sure if this is what he had in mind.
		- More formally: I have a quick calculation that shows
			- $$ \mu^2s_c^2\sigma_{\min, \text{restricted}}^2(I_R^TG^TG) \leq \| \mathsf{signal} \|_F^2 \leq \mu^2s_c^2\sigma_{\max, \text{restricted}}^2(I_R^TG^TG)$$
		- what does this get us?
