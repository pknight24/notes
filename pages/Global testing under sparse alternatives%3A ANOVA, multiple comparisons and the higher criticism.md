	- Testing for the signiﬁcance of a subset of regression coeﬃcients in a linear model, a staple of statistical analysis, goes back at least to the work of Fisher who introduced the analysis of variance (ANOVA). We study this problem under the assumption that the coeﬃcient vector is sparse, a common situation in modern high-dimensional settings. Suppose we have p covariates and that under the alternative, the response only depends upon on the order of p1−α of those, 0 ≤ α ≤ 1. Under moderate sparsity levels, i.e. 0 ≤ α ≤ 1/2, we show that ANOVA is essentially optimal under some conditions on the design. This is no longer the case under strong sparsity constraints, i.e. α > 1/2. In such settings, a multiple comparison procedure is often preferred and we establish its optimality when α ≥ 3/4. However, these two very popular methods are suboptimal, and sometimes powerless, under moderately strong sparsity where 1/2 < α < 3/4. We suggest a method based on the Higher Criticism that is powerful in the whole range α > 1/2. This optimality property is true for a variety of designs, including the classical (balanced) multi-way designs and more modern ‘p > n’ designs arising in genetics and signal processing. In addition to the standard ﬁxed eﬀects model, we establish similar results for a random eﬀects model where the nonzero coeﬃcients of the regression vector are normally distributed.
