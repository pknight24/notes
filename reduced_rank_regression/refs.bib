	title = {Generalized Matrix Decomposition Regression: Estimation and Inference for Two-way Structured Data},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.08408},
	shorttitle = {Generalized Matrix Decomposition Regression},
	abstract = {This paper studies high-dimensional regression with two-way structured data. To estimate the high-dimensional coefficient vector, we propose the generalized matrix decomposition regression ({GMDR}) to efficiently leverage any auxiliary information on row and column structures. The {GMDR} extends the principal component regression ({PCR}) to two-way structured data, but unlike {PCR}, the {GMDR} selects the components that are most predictive of the outcome, leading to more accurate prediction. For inference on regression coefficients of individual variables, we propose the generalized matrix decomposition inference ({GMDI}), a general high-dimensional inferential framework for a large family of estimators that include the proposed {GMDR} estimator. {GMDI} provides more flexibility for modeling relevant auxiliary row and column structures. As a result, {GMDI} does not require the true regression coefficients to be sparse; it also allows dependent and heteroscedastic observations. We study the theoretical properties of {GMDI} in terms of both the type-I error rate and power and demonstrate the effectiveness of {GMDR} and {GMDI} on simulation studies and an application to human microbiome data.},
